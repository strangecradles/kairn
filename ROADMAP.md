## v2.x — Kairn Evolve (Automated Harness Optimization)

> Inspired by [Meta-Harness](https://yoonholee.com/meta-harness/) (Lee et al., Stanford IRIS Lab, 2026), [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) (Khattab et al.), [OpenEvolve](https://github.com/algorithmicsuperintelligence/openevolve), and [TextGrad](https://github.com/zou-group/textgrad). Instead of just generating environments, Kairn evolves them — running agents on real tasks, logging full traces, and using causal reasoning to improve the harness iteratively.

Full design doc: [`docs/design/v2.0-kairn-evolve.md`](docs/design/v2.0-kairn-evolve.md)

### v2.0.0 ✅ — Task Definition & Trace Infrastructure
- [x] Eval template menu — 6 built-in templates (add-feature, fix-bug, refactor, test-writing, config-change, documentation)
- [x] Auto-generated evals — LLM reads `.claude/CLAUDE.md` + project structure, selects templates, generates 3-5 concrete project-specific tasks
- [x] `kairn evolve init` — scaffold evolution workspace (`.kairn-evolve/`), auto-generate `tasks.yaml`, interactive "add another eval?" flow
- [x] Baseline snapshot (`kairn evolve baseline`) — copy current `.claude/` as iteration 0
- [x] Task runner — execute agent on a single task, capture full trace to filesystem
- [x] Trace schema: `traces/{iteration}/{task_id}/` containing stdout, tool_calls.json, files_changed.json, score.json
- [x] Pass/fail scorer (default) + LLM-as-judge scorer (configurable) + rubric scorer
- [x] `kairn evolve run --task <id>` — run a single task against current environment

### v2.1.0 ✅ — The Evolution Loop
- [x] `kairn evolve run` — full evaluation (run all tasks, aggregate scores)
- [x] Proposer agent — reads trace filesystem, diagnoses failures, proposes harness mutations
- [x] Harness diff engine — apply proposed mutations to CLAUDE.md / commands / rules / agents
- [x] Iteration loop: evaluate → diagnose → mutate → re-evaluate
- [x] `kairn evolve run --iterations N` — control search budget (default: 5)
- [x] Iteration log: `iterations/{N}/` with mutation_diff.patch, scores.json, proposer_reasoning.md
- [x] Rollback on regression (score drops → revert to previous best)

### v2.2.0 ✅ — Diagnosis & Reporting
- [x] Counterfactual diagnosis ("this CLAUDE.md change helped task A but hurt task B — why?")
- [x] Per-task trace diffing (what changed between iteration N and N+1 for the same task?)
- [x] `kairn evolve report` — human-readable Markdown summary of the evolution run
- [x] `kairn evolve report --json` — machine-readable for CI/pipelines
- [x] Evolution leaderboard (table of iterations × tasks × scores)
- [x] `kairn evolve diff <iter1> <iter2>` — show harness changes between iterations

### v2.2.1 — Proposer JSON Fix + Mutation Scope Expansion (Bugfix)
> Discovered during Kairn-on-Kairn test runs. **#1 blocker:** Proposer returns English prose instead of JSON — no mutations are ever applied. Also: mutations are additive-only, MCP is outside scope, proposer prompt biases toward growth.

- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Add `jsonMode` to `callLLM()` with assistant prefill (Anthropic) and `response_format` (OpenAI)
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Robust JSON extraction in parser — handle prose-wrapped JSON (first `{` to last `}`)
- [ ] Wire `jsonMode: true` in proposer LLM call
- [ ] Add `delete_section` and `delete_file` mutation actions to types and mutator
- [ ] Include `.mcp.json` in harness scope (baseline snapshot, runner deployment, proposer reading)
- [ ] Rebalance proposer prompt: consider both additions AND removals, list all mutation actions, strengthen JSON instruction
- [ ] Update proposer JSON parser to accept `delete_section` and `delete_file` actions
- [ ] Tests: JSON extraction from prose, assistant prefill, delete mutations, MCP snapshot, balanced proposer

### v2.3.0 — Advanced Scoring & Search
- [ ] Custom scoring functions (user-defined Python/TS scoring scripts)
- [ ] Multi-objective scoring (correctness × efficiency × token cost)
- [ ] Search strategy selection: greedy (default), best-of-N, population-based (OpenEvolve-style)
- [ ] Held-out validation set (train/test split for tasks to prevent overfitting)
- [ ] Prompt caching integration (Anthropic ephemeral caching for trace reads)
- [ ] Cost tracking per iteration (total tokens, API cost, wall time)

### v2.4.0 — Polish & Integration
- [ ] `kairn evolve watch` — live dashboard during evolution (progress, scores, current mutation)
- [ ] Integration with `kairn describe` ("generate, then auto-evolve for 3 iterations")
- [ ] Integration with `kairn optimize` ("audit, then evolve the fixes")
- [ ] Template evolution (evolve a template against its canonical tasks)
- [ ] Export evolved environment as a new Kairn template
- [ ] CI/CD integration guide (run `kairn evolve` in GitHub Actions)
- [ ] User-authored custom evals — write tasks from scratch (not from templates), custom scoring scripts, arbitrary verification logic

---

## v3.x — Hosted Compilation

- [ ] Free hosted compilation endpoint — no local LLM key needed
- [ ] Web dashboard for environment management
- [ ] Template marketplace — share and discover environments
- [ ] Detect and adapt to existing user MCP servers

---

## v4.x — Integrated Payments

- [ ] Zero-friction tool provisioning via Stripe MPP
- [ ] Usage tracking and spending controls
- [ ] BYOK (bring your own key) flow for non-MPP tools

---

## v5.x — Learning System

- [ ] Automated tool discovery (GitHub, npm, community)
- [ ] Usage-based quality scoring
- [ ] Workflow-to-environment recommendation model

---

## Principles

1. **Minimal over complete.** Fewer, well-chosen tools beat many generic ones.
2. **Workflow-specific over generic.** Every generated file relates to the actual task.
3. **Local-first.** Everything works offline. Hosted features are optional.
4. **Transparent.** Users can inspect every generated file.
5. **Security by default.** Every environment includes deny rules and security guidance.
6. **Self-improving.** Environments should get better with use, not just at generation time.
