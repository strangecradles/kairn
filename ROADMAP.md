## v2.x — Kairn Evolve (Automated Harness Optimization)

> Inspired by [Meta-Harness](https://yoonholee.com/meta-harness/) (Lee et al., Stanford IRIS Lab, 2026), [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) (Khattab et al.), [OpenEvolve](https://github.com/algorithmicsuperintelligence/openevolve), and [TextGrad](https://github.com/zou-group/textgrad). Instead of just generating environments, Kairn evolves them — running agents on real tasks, logging full traces, and using causal reasoning to improve the harness iteratively.

Full design doc: [`docs/design/v2.0-kairn-evolve.md`](docs/design/v2.0-kairn-evolve.md)

### v2.0.0 ✅ — Task Definition & Trace Infrastructure
- [x] Eval template menu — 6 built-in templates (add-feature, fix-bug, refactor, test-writing, config-change, documentation)
- [x] Auto-generated evals — LLM reads `.claude/CLAUDE.md` + project structure, selects templates, generates 3-5 concrete project-specific tasks
- [x] `kairn evolve init` — scaffold evolution workspace (`.kairn-evolve/`), auto-generate `tasks.yaml`, interactive "add another eval?" flow
- [x] Baseline snapshot (`kairn evolve baseline`) — copy current `.claude/` as iteration 0
- [x] Task runner — execute agent on a single task, capture full trace to filesystem
- [x] Trace schema: `traces/{iteration}/{task_id}/` containing stdout, tool_calls.json, files_changed.json, score.json
- [x] Pass/fail scorer (default) + LLM-as-judge scorer (configurable) + rubric scorer
- [x] `kairn evolve run --task <id>` — run a single task against current environment

### v2.1.0 ✅ — The Evolution Loop
- [x] `kairn evolve run` — full evaluation (run all tasks, aggregate scores)
- [x] Proposer agent — reads trace filesystem, diagnoses failures, proposes harness mutations
- [x] Harness diff engine — apply proposed mutations to CLAUDE.md / commands / rules / agents
- [x] Iteration loop: evaluate → diagnose → mutate → re-evaluate
- [x] `kairn evolve run --iterations N` — control search budget (default: 5)
- [x] Iteration log: `iterations/{N}/` with mutation_diff.patch, scores.json, proposer_reasoning.md
- [x] Rollback on regression (score drops → revert to previous best)

### v2.2.0 ✅ — Diagnosis & Reporting
- [x] Counterfactual diagnosis ("this CLAUDE.md change helped task A but hurt task B — why?")
- [x] Per-task trace diffing (what changed between iteration N and N+1 for the same task?)
- [x] `kairn evolve report` — human-readable Markdown summary of the evolution run
- [x] `kairn evolve report --json` — machine-readable for CI/pipelines
- [x] Evolution leaderboard (table of iterations × tasks × scores)
- [x] `kairn evolve diff <iter1> <iter2>` — show harness changes between iterations

### v2.2.1 ✅ SHIPPED
> Mutations were additive-only; MCP configuration excluded from scope; proposer biased toward growth rather than optimization.

- [x] Add `delete_section` and `delete_file` mutation actions to types and mutator
- [x] Include `.mcp.json` in harness scope (baseline snapshot, runner deployment, proposer reading)
- [x] Rebalance proposer prompt: consider both additions AND removals, list all mutation actions
- [x] Update proposer JSON parser to accept `delete_section` and `delete_file` actions
- [x] Tests: delete mutations, MCP snapshot, balanced proposer

### v2.2.2 ✅ SHIPPED
> **#1 blocker fixed:** Proposer was returning English prose instead of JSON. Added JSON mode to LLM call with fallback parsing.

- [x] Add `jsonMode` to `callLLM()` with assistant prefill (Anthropic) and `response_format` (OpenAI)
- [x] Robust JSON extraction in parser — handle prose-wrapped JSON (first `{` to last `}`)
- [x] Wire `jsonMode: true` in proposer LLM call
- [x] Tests: JSON extraction from prose, assistant prefill behavior

### v2.2.4 ✅ SHIPPED (was v2.2.3 plan)
> v2.2.1 shipped the mutation types and v2.2.2 fixed proposer JSON. This version proves the full loop works: mutations actually apply, scores actually move, evolved > static is demonstrable.

- [x] `kairn evolve apply [--iter N]` — copy best harness to `.claude/` with diff preview (highest-friction UX gap)
- [x] **Integration test:** full loop with deterministic mocks proves score improves, rollback works, errors recover
- [x] Variance controls: `--runs N` runs each task N times, reports mean ± stddev per task
- [ ] **Proof artifact:** before/after comparison showing evolved harness outperforms static on a held-out task (deferred to v2.3.0)

### v2.2.5 ✅ SHIPPED
> Parallel task evaluation — the single biggest wall-clock speedup for evolution runs.

- [x] Parallel task evaluation: `--parallel N` runs up to N tasks concurrently (promise-based, native)
- [x] `runWithConcurrency` utility with configurable concurrency limit
- [x] Backward compatible: `--parallel 1` (default) = sequential, identical to prior behavior

### v2.2.6 ✅ SHIPPED
> Bug fix: Anthropic API rejects assistant prefill on newer models.

- [x] Remove assistant prefill for Anthropic jsonMode — rely on prompt instructions + JSON extraction fallback

### v2.2.7 ✅ SHIPPED
> Harness-sensitive evals + adaptive eval pruning.

- [x] Adaptive eval pruning: skip tasks above threshold on middle iterations, run all on first/last
- [x] Harness-sensitive tasks.yaml: 5 evals testing harness quality (verification workflow, convention adherence, git discipline, slash commands, architecture mandate)
- [x] Blind proposer: stripped eval rubrics from proposer context to prevent gaming
- [x] Anti-gaming constraints in proposer system prompt

### v2.2.8 ✅ SHIPPED
> ML-inspired optimization controls for the evolution loop.

- [x] `maxMutationsPerIteration` (default: 3) — cap mutations per step, prevents catastrophic regressions
- [x] Loss-weighted proposer focus — traces sorted worst-first, proposer focuses on what's broken
- [x] `pruneThreshold` (default: 95) — configurable threshold for adaptive pruning
- [x] `maxTaskDrop` (default: 20) — per-task regression guard, rolls back if any task drops too much

### v2.2.10 ✅ SHIPPED
> Rollback noise trap fix.

- [x] After rollback, proposer proposes NEW mutations on best harness instead of re-evaluating unchanged harness
- [x] `.mcp.json` included in `evolve apply` output (harness scope fix)

### v2.3.0 ✅ SHIPPED
> The evolution loop is only as good as its eval signal. Before adding features, make measurement trustworthy.

**Eval Quality (the bottleneck):**
- [ ] Failure taxonomy: was it the harness? the task? the model? the repo state? Log classification per task failure
- [ ] Canonical benchmark corpus: small set of stable, version-controlled tasks alongside project-specific evals
- [ ] Confidence intervals: report mean ± stddev across N runs per task in `kairn evolve report`
- [ ] Custom scoring functions (user-defined scoring scripts in `.kairn-evolve/`)

**Auth & Cost:**
- [ ] **Claude Code subscription auth (experimental)** — at `kairn init`, offer "Use Claude Code subscription" option that reads OAuth tokens from macOS Keychain (`Claude Code-credentials`), refreshes on expiry, and passes as API key. All LLM calls (compilation, proposer, scorer) bill to user's Claude subscription instead of separate API key. Upfront warning: undocumented, may break. Full system prompt and model selection support (OAuth token = API key for Anthropic SDK). Linux/Windows credential store support TBD.
- [ ] Prompt caching integration (Anthropic ephemeral caching for trace reads — ~85% token savings)
- [ ] Cost tracking per iteration (total tokens, USD cost, wall time) in report

**Iteration Speed:**
- [x] ~~Parallel task evaluation~~ — shipped in v2.2.5

**DX Quick Wins:**
- [ ] Fix hardcoded CLI version → read from package.json dynamically
- [ ] Capture tool calls & MCP usage from runner output → tool_calls.json
- [ ] Harness utilization metrics (which tools/agents/rules were used vs available)

### v2.4.0 — Intelligent Evolution (RL-inspired) [NEXT]
> The evolution loop is a text-space optimization algorithm. These features make it behave more like a proper optimizer: mini-batch sampling, meta-learning, exploration scheduling.

**Principal Proposer (meta-learner):**
- [ ] After N-1 normal iterations, a separate "Principal" LLM call reads ALL iteration logs (proposals, diffs, score deltas, rollback reasons) and synthesizes a single best harness from the baseline
- [ ] Different system prompt: "You are reviewing the entire evolution run. Cherry-pick the best mutations, avoid regressions, synthesize the optimal harness."
- [ ] Evaluated as the final iteration with full eval suite — the intelligent distillation of the entire run's learnings

**Mini-batch eval sampling (stochastic gradient):**
- [ ] Maintain a pool of 10-15 evals. Each iteration samples K (e.g., 5). Different subsets cycle through.
- [ ] Implicit regularization: can't overfit to one subset. Broader coverage over many iterations.
- [ ] Inspired by mini-batch SGD — see different "angles" of the harness each step.

**Exploration/exploitation schedule:**
- [ ] Early iterations: higher mutation cap, bolder changes, diverse eval samples (exploration)
- [ ] Late iterations: lower mutation cap, conservative refinements, full eval sweep (exploitation)
- [ ] Like epsilon-greedy with decay, or learning rate warmup → cosine annealing

**Experience replay (cross-run learning):**
- [ ] Persist a "proposer memory" of what mutations worked/failed across multiple `evolve run` sessions
- [ ] The proposer reads prior run summaries before proposing — learns from history, not just current traces
- [ ] This is the data flywheel: each run makes future runs smarter

### v2.5.0 ✅ — Intent-Aware Harnesses (Two-Tier Evolving Router)
> "No commands to memorize, just describe what you want" — but project-specific, compiled from the codebase, and self-improving. Inspired by OMC's keyword detection but uses Claude Code's native prompt hooks for semantic fallback.

Full design doc: [`docs/design/v2.5-intent-routing.md`](docs/design/v2.5-intent-routing.md)

**Generation pipeline (kairn describe):**
- [x] Intent pattern compilation: each generated command → 1-3 regex patterns (name, synonyms, framework verbs)
- [x] Generate `.claude/hooks/intent-router.mjs` — Tier 1 regex engine with project-specific patterns
- [x] Generate Tier 2 prompt template — compiled workflow + agent manifest baked into `settings.json` prompt hook
- [x] Generate `.claude/hooks/intent-learner.mjs` — background pattern promotion (Tier 2 → Tier 1)
- [x] Write `UserPromptSubmit` + `SessionStart` hooks into `.claude/settings.json`
- [x] Extend `EnvironmentSpec.harness` with `hooks`, `intent_patterns`, `intent_prompt_template`

**Evolution pipeline (kairn evolve):**
- [x] Proposer reads intent patterns + Tier 2 prompt as harness context
- [x] New mutation targets: `add_intent_pattern`, `modify_intent_prompt`
- [x] Harness snapshot/apply includes `.claude/hooks/` directory
- [x] New eval template: `intent-routing` — test that NL prompts route to correct commands

**Self-learning (background, no CLI command):**
- [x] Tier 2 routings logged to `.claude/hooks/intent-log.jsonl`
- [x] `intent-learner.mjs` runs on `SessionStart`: promotes recurring Tier 2 patterns to Tier 1 regexes
- [x] Audit trail: `.claude/hooks/intent-promotions.jsonl`
- [x] Data flywheel: Run 1 (40% regex) → Run 10 (90% regex) — harness learns user vocabulary

### v2.5.2 ✅ SHIPPED — Evolve Permissions Fix & Expanded Eval Menu
> The evolve loop's signal is corrupted by permission prompts blocking agents in `--print` mode, and the eval menu is too small (5 tasks) for diverse proposer signal. Fix both.

- [x] `--dangerously-skip-permissions` in `spawnClaude()` — eval worktrees are disposable, permission system is a confound
- [x] Expanded eval menu: 5 → 12 tasks (7 new medium-weight harness-sensitivity probes)
- [x] Mini-batch sampling enabled: `eval_sample_size: 5` — each middle iteration samples 5 of 12 tasks
- [x] New eval dimensions: fs.promises convention, chalk color mapping, error boundary pattern, security path validation, conventional commit format, @inquirer/prompts check, env\_ ID prefix
- [x] Clean baseline reset (remove permission-workaround mutations from prior iterations)

### v2.6.0 ✅ SHIPPED — Population-Based Harness Evolution
> A single sequential trajectory wastes wall-clock time on dead ends and overfits to its task sample. PBT runs N independent trajectories with different task subsets, a Meta-Principal synthesizes the best harness, Thompson Sampling drives uncertainty-aware task selection, and KL regularization prevents harness bloat.

Full plan: [`PLAN-v2.6.0.md`](PLAN-v2.6.0.md)

**Thompson Sampling (uncertainty-driven task selection):**
- [x] Beta distribution per task (`alpha`/`beta` params) — uncertain tasks sampled more often
- [x] Replaces uniform random mini-batch sampling in `loop.ts`
- [x] Beliefs persist across iterations in `task-beliefs.json`
- [x] `--sampling thompson|uniform` CLI flag (Thompson is default)

**KL Regularization (complexity penalty):**
- [x] `measureComplexity()` — counts lines, files, sections, rules across harness
- [x] `computeComplexityCost()` — weighted diff from baseline (normalized 0-1)
- [x] `effective_score = raw_score - λ * complexityCost * 100`
- [x] `--kl-lambda` CLI flag (default: 0.1, 0 = disabled)
- [x] Prevents CLAUDE.md bloat — proposer must earn every addition

**Population-Based Training (parallel evolution branches):**
- [x] `kairn evolve pbt` — spawn N parallel evolution trajectories (default: 3)
- [x] Each branch: independent workspace, unique RNG seed, own Thompson beliefs
- [x] Branches run concurrently — similar wall time to single run, 3x exploration
- [x] Meta-Principal reads ALL branch results, cherry-picks best mutations, synthesizes final harness
- [x] Synthesis evaluated against full task suite — must beat best individual branch
- [x] `kairn evolve apply --pbt` to deploy the winning harness

### v2.7.0 ✅ SHIPPED — Structured Harness IR ([design doc](docs/design/v2.7-harness-ir.md))
> Raw Markdown mutation will corrupt formatting, accumulate contradictions, and break as files grow. A structured intermediate representation makes mutations composable, diffing meaningful, and format migration tractable.

Full plan: [`PLAN-v2.7.0.md`](PLAN-v2.7.0.md)

- [x] **Harness IR type model** — typed data model for CLAUDE.md sections, commands, rules, agents, skills, docs, hooks, settings, MCP servers, intents
- [x] **Parser** — `.claude/` directory → HarnessIR (CLAUDE.md section splitting, YAML frontmatter, settings.json, .mcp.json)
- [x] **Renderer** — HarnessIR → `.claude/` files (deterministic, lossless, round-trip tested)
- [x] **Round-trip test** — parse→render→parse preserves all content on real and synthetic harnesses
- [x] **IR mutations** — 17 typed mutation operations (sections, commands, rules, agents, MCP, settings) with immutable application and pre-condition validation
- [x] **Semantic diff engine** — compares IR trees by node ID/name, produces human-readable diffs with +/-/~/↕ markers
- [x] **Legacy translation layer** — bridges text-based proposer Mutations to typed IRMutations with raw_text fallback
- [x] **Evolution loop integration** — mutator uses IR pipeline internally (parse→translate→apply→render), copy-first/render-selectively preserves untouched files, IR-aware complexity measurement for KL regularization

### v2.8.0 ✅ SHIPPED — Evolution Quality
> Hybrid scoring, Anthropic prompt caching, proposer model optimization, and targeted re-evaluation.

- [x] **Hybrid scoring** — deterministic rubric criteria alongside LLM-as-judge (weighted blend, configurable)
- [x] **Anthropic prompt caching** for system prompts (~85% token savings on repeated proposer/scorer calls)
- [x] **Default proposer model → Sonnet** — comparable quality at ~5x lower cost than Opus
- [x] **Targeted re-evaluation** — after mutation, re-run only tasks whose scores are likely affected (saves ~40% eval cost)

### v2.9.0 — Harness Quality: Anthropic Patterns ([plan](PLAN-v2.9.0.md))
> Comparative analysis against [Anthropic's official harness design guidance](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/harness-design-long-running-apps), [Everything Claude Code](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code) (151 skills, 102 security rules), and [Oh-My-ClaudeCode](https://github.com/yeachan-heo/oh-my-claudecode) (smart model routing) revealed 6 gaps in generated harness quality.

- [ ] **Sprint contracts** — @architect outputs acceptance criteria, @verifier validates per-criterion before coding
- [ ] **Smart model routing** — agents include tiered routing (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus) based on task complexity, with `modelRouting` IR field
- [ ] **Context reset protocol** — alternative to PostCompact for long sessions (full reset + handoff artifact)
- [ ] **Memory persistence hooks** — SessionStart/End save/load `.claude/memory.json` across sessions
- [ ] **Expanded security rules** — PreToolUse patterns from 5 to 20+ (credential leaks, injection, destructive ops, network)
- [ ] **Pruning policy** — principle: harness complexity should decrease as models improve

### v2.10.0 — Polish & Integration (moved from v2.8.0)
- [ ] `kairn evolve watch` — live dashboard during evolution (progress, scores, current mutation)
- [ ] Integration with `kairn describe` ("generate, then auto-evolve for 3 iterations")
- [ ] Integration with `kairn optimize` ("audit, then evolve the fixes")
- [ ] Template evolution (evolve a template against its canonical tasks)
- [ ] Export evolved environment as a new Kairn template
- [ ] CI/CD integration guide (run `kairn evolve` in GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Multi-objective scoring (correctness × efficiency × cost) with weighted aggregation
- [ ] Search strategy selection: greedy (default), best-of-N, population-based

---

## Future Directions (Aspirational)

> These are directional ideas, not committed milestones. They depend on v2.x proving its thesis (evolved > static with rigor) and on finding a monetization trigger.

### Broad Harness Scope (v2.x → v3.x evolution)
The "harness" is bigger than `.claude/`. Today Kairn manages instructions and MCP configs. The full harness includes everything that shapes agent behavior:

**Current scope (v2.x):**
- `.claude/` — instructions, commands, rules, agents, settings.json
- `.mcp.json` — MCP server configurations

**Near-term expansion (v2.6+):**
- `.claude/plugins/` — Claude Code plugin configs
- Tool API key connections (`.env` with Sentry, Vercel, etc. keys)
- The proposer should be able to suggest "add Sentry MCP server" as a mutation

**Runtime-agnostic scope (v3.x / Hermes / OpenClaw):**
- Runtime-specific configs (`.hermes/config.yaml`, OpenClaw equivalents)
- API-authenticated external tool connections (not just local MCP)
- Plugin/extension configs per runtime
- The evolution loop operates on a runtime-agnostic harness IR, adapters write runtime-specific files

### Paid Tool Connections & Micropayments
When the proposer discovers that adding an external tool (Sentry, Datadog, a paid MCP server) would improve task scores, the user needs a way to connect and pay:
- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key):** User provides API keys for tools the proposer suggests — current model, works today
- **Stripe MPP / x402 micropayments:** "This mutation adds Sentry monitoring. Connect for $0.02/query?" — proposer-initiated tool acquisition with per-use billing
- **Tool marketplace with metered billing:** Browse, connect, and pay for tool access within Kairn — the evolution loop becomes a discovery mechanism for useful tools

### Harness Generator Quality
- Upgrade agent template quality (learn from OMC's agent design patterns: role scoping, `disallowedTools`, `<Why_This_Matters>`, model tiering)
- Generate per-environment **WORKFLOWS.md** walkthrough (context-aware, regenerated after evolve)

### Extended Marketplace Integration
- Plugin search: Claude Code plugin marketplaces (anthropics, omc, openai-codex) alongside MCP server directories (Smithery, mcp.run, glama.ai)
- Agent template library: parameterized by project type, proposer can suggest additions during evolution

### Hosted Platform
- Free hosted compilation endpoint (requires: auth, multi-tenancy, trace privacy, abuse prevention, uptime)
- Web dashboard, template marketplace
- Payments integration (Stripe MPP, BYOK, x402)

### Learning System
- Automated tool discovery (GitHub, npm, community)
- Usage-based quality scoring
- Cross-project evolution data flywheel

## Principles

1. **Minimal over complete.** Fewer, well-chosen tools beat many generic ones.
2. **Workflow-specific over generic.** Every generated file relates to the actual task.
3. **Local-first.** Everything works offline. Hosted features are optional.
4. **Transparent.** Users can inspect every generated file.
5. **Security by default.** Every environment includes deny rules and security guidance.
6. **Self-improving.** Environments should get better with use, not just at generation time.
7. **Prove it.** Evolved harnesses must demonstrably outperform static ones. Claims without measurement rigor are noise.
8. **Prune what's no longer load-bearing.** Every harness section assumes a model limitation. When models improve, audit and remove scaffolding that the model handles natively. Harness complexity should decrease over time, not only grow.
